# Code.Sprint 2018

## Task 1 - Automated Teller Machines 

Automated teller machines (ATM) require the user to enter a PIN Number to access the bank card. Write a program that simulates this part of the ATM program. The program should ask the user to enter a four-numbered PIN code. If it matches the PIN code assigned to the Bank Card, it displays "CORRECT PIN"; otherwise it displays "INCORRECT PIN". The program should warn the user that the ATM will hold the bank card by displaying "BANK CARD HELD" upon entering the wrong PIN code for three (3) consecutive times.

## Program Rules:

▪ PIN assigned to Bank Card is a constant value - 9681.

▪ If the PIN code entered does not match the proper format (not a 4-numbered pin), the program displays "INVALID PIN FORMAT" and does not count the entry as an incorrect PIN.

▪ It is assumed that only numbers are entered by the user since only numpads are usually available on ATMs
